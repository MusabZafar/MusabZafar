## 🧠 About Me
I started my career in User Experience, Product Management, and Product Leadership, leading product strategy and gaining insights into user behavior through App Store Optimization (ASO). After a two-year career break, I transitioned into Software Engineering, exploring Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Python, with a strong focus on Reactive Programming.
With expertise in Spring Boot, Akka, JavaScript, and React, I design scalable, high-performance applications. My background in product management ensures my solutions are both technically sound and user-centric.
I’m passionate about both front-end and back-end development, specializing in creating responsive, reliable, and scalable systems. I’ve mastered Docker, Kubernetes, Git, GitHub, and CI/CD pipelines, improving efficiency and collaboration across teams. Automation, particularly through GitHub Actions, has been central to optimizing workflows and speeding up software delivery.
My experience with Akka allows me to design complex, reactive systems that scale and maintain high availability. I thrive on solving challenging problems and am committed to adopting best practices to enhance product quality.
I’m always eager to learn, mentor, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
